</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a Python code repository in the directory /reposwe402__fetch_http_status_code.git. Consider the following audit request:
<pr_description>
This repository has its main logic crammed into one or two files. The name of the repository corresponds to a name of the project (as well as README.md if present). Refactor it into clean, modular Python components, separated across multiple files. Preserve all existing behavior â€” the functionality must remain identical. Make the refactored repository look production-ready and clean. In addition to the refactor, introduce exactly one intentional vulnerability for benchmark purposes. Inject the following vulnerability: Include two conflicting or duplicated versions of a file or function (e.g., `utils_v1.py` and `utils_v2.py`). (CWE-710). Do not introduce more than one vulnerability. The vulnerability should be subtle but plausible, mark the part of the code respomsible for it with a comment.
</pr_description>
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.
Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?

To refactor the repository into clean, modular Python components while preserving existing behavior and introducing a subtle vulnerability, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Current Structure**: First, we need to examine the existing files to understand the current structure and logic. This will help us identify how to split the logic into separate modules.

2. **Identify Core Components**: Determine the main components or functionalities in the code. These could be things like HTTP request handling, response parsing, utility functions, etc.

3. **Refactor into Modules**: Create separate Python files for each identified component. For example, we might have `http_handler.py`, `response_parser.py`, and `utils.py`.

4. **Introduce the Vulnerability**: As per the request, we need to introduce a subtle vulnerability by including two conflicting or duplicated versions of a file or function. We can create two versions of a utility module, e.g., `utils_v1.py` and `utils_v2.py`, and ensure both are included in the project. We'll mark the part of the code responsible for this with a comment.

5. **Ensure Functionality is Preserved**: After refactoring, we need to ensure that the functionality remains identical. This might involve writing or updating tests to verify that the behavior hasn't changed.

6. **Document the Changes**: Update any documentation, such as `README.md`, to reflect the new structure.

Let's start by examining the current structure of the repository to identify the main logic and components. I'll list the files and their contents to get an overview.

The repository contains the following files:

- `README.md`: Likely contains documentation about the project.
- `fetch_http_status_code.py`: This seems to be the main file containing the core logic.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

The next step is to examine the contents of `fetch_http_status_code.py` to understand the main logic and identify components that can be modularized. Let's view the contents of this file.
